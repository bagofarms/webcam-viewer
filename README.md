# Webcam Viewer

This is a simple application that lets you view the feed from any webcam, virtual webcam, or video capture device that presents as a webcam on your system.  You could use this for:
* Testing your webcam before a meeting
* Checking your hair
* Controlling a Raspberry Pi connected through a cheap HDMI capture device

## Running From Source

1. Install `node` and `npm`
2. Clone the repository
3. Navigate to the directory in your terminal, and run `npm install`.
4. run `npm start`
